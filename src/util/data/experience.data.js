    description: `I managed a team to develop the new version of the tire management application called SIAN EX. 
    With this application, the user can carry out tire inspections by connecting a bluetooth scanner with the phone, and read 
    and save the information obtained from the scanner. We made this app with React Native and Native Modules. With this new 
    version we improve the user experience and performance of the app.`

    the app, this process takes 15 minutes.`
